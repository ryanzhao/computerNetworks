<h2><center>Project 1: Public <em>traceroute</em> Server</center></h2>
<h2><center>Assigned: 9/7/12, Due: <b> 11:59pm on 9/25/12 (Tuesday))</b>
</center> </h2><br>

<h2> Project Goals </h2>

<p>The <b>traceroute</b> utility can be used to infer the end-to-end
paths packets take.  It is commonly used for network diagnostics and
for researchers interested in creating Internet topologies.  Since it
is hard to create Internet-scale topologies from one physical
location, public traceroute servers are often used to infer end-to-end
paths from additional vantage points.  In this project you will create
a public traceroute server, which will help you learn sockets
programming. Before writing your client program, you will connect to
the server using the <b>telnet</b> utility.</p>

<h2> Project Specification </h2>

<h3> Expected Server Functionality: </h3>

<p> Your server should run on the CS Linux machines on a specified
port.  The operator of this server would invoke it as:
"./<em>tracerouteServer</em> [option1, ..., optionN]".  The possible
options are (if a particular option is not specified, its default
value should be used): </p>

<ul> 
     <li>   PORT &lt;port number&gt; </li>
     <li>   RATE &lt;number requests&gt; &lt;number seconds&gt; </li>
     <li>   MAX_USERS &lt;number of users&gt; </li>
     <li>   STRICT_DEST &lt;0 or 1&gt; </li>

</ul>

<p> The above options may be implemented using either a simple
list of key/value pairs or using Unix style arguments as show
below:</p>

<ul>
  <li> Key/value pairs: ./tracerouteServer PORT 1025 MAX_USERS 4 </li>
  <li> Long Unix style: ./tracerouteServer --port=1025 --max_users=4 </li>
  <li> Short Unix style: ./tracerouteServer -p 1025 -u 4 </li>
</ul>

<p> Details of each option are given below: </p>
<ul>

<li> <b> Listening port (PORT): </b> The operator should be able to
specify what TCP port the traceroute server listens on. Possible
values: 1025 - 65536. Default: 1216.<br><br></li>

<li> <a name="rate"></a><b> Rate limiting (RATE):</b> Public
traceroute servers could be an avenue for abuse if their usage were
not restricted.  To guard against that, the server operator should be
able to specify the number of traceroutes that can be issued by a
given client in a given number of seconds. Traceroute requests issued
in excess of this rate should be discarded, and the occurrence of this
condition <a href="traceServer.html#log">logged at the server</a>. The client should
<b>not</b> be disconnected for violating rate limiting. Instead, they
should receive an error message indicating their command was not
processed. Default: 4 requests per user per 60 seconds.<br><br></li>

<li> <b> Maximum number of concurrent users (MAX_USERS):
</b> Only a given number of users should be able to connect to the
traceroute server at a given time. Above this threshold, connecting
users should receive an error message indicating the server is busy
before the connection is then terminated by the server. Such refused
connections should be <a href="traceServer.html#log">logged at the server</a>. When a
user disconnects, a slot should be opened for another
connection. Default: 2 users.<br><br> </li>

<li> <b> Target IP addresses (STRICT_DEST): </b> Your server should
have the option of allowing the operator to ensure that the users are
only allowed to send traceroutes to their own IP address.  This is to
reduce abuse complaints or to prevent its usage in DDoS attacks. The
operator should be able to toggle whether this restriction is in
place. Use "0" to denote the restriction is not in place and "1" to
denote it is. If a user attempts to traceroute an IP other than their
own when STRICT_DEST is enabled, they should receive an error message
explaining the restriction and the event should
be <a href="traceServer.html#log">logged at the server</a>. The client
should <b>not</b> be disconnected for violating STRICT_DEST. Default:
0.<br><br></li>

</ul>

<p><a name="log"></a><b> Administrative log: </b> The administrative
  log reports user activity and system behavior for the server
  operator. All entries should be prefixed with the time
  in <b>MM/DD/YY HH:MM:SS</b> format, where "MM/DD/YY" is the date and
  "HH:MM:SS" is the timestamp in international format (HH can take
  values from 0-23). Whenever a user issues a traceroute, an entry
  should be written indicating the destination machine's IP address or
  host name. When a file is tracerouted, an entry should be recorded
  for each command processed from the file. The log file must also
  contain information about server startups, connections and
  disconnections from users, events as described by the
  RATE/MAX_USERS/STRICT_DEST instructions, and any other information
  regarding user behavior or system events.  Document all the types of
  messages that can appear in your log file.</p>

<p><b>Expectations on concurrency:</b> We require that each connecting client
have a seperate thread or process spawned to handle its interactions.  No
possible execution paths of these concurrent threads or processes should lead
to an error.  Specifically, ensure that you protect all functions and library
calls explicitly unless they are noted to be thread safe.  As an example, when
updating the administrative log file, make sure that events corresponding to
multiple clients are recorded correctly.  All memory should be freed when your
server program exits.  Specificaly, there should not be any memory leaks or
zombie threads or processes.  Do not rely on the OS to clean up terminated
threads or processes.</p>

<h3> Expected Client and Server Interaction: </h3>

<p>When testing and demoing your server, you should use the Linux
<b>telnet</b> utility. At the end of the project, you will write a
simple client that provides the basic functionality of the
<b>telnet</b> utility. In order to troubleshoot, you should write the
client after confirming the server works properly using <b>telnet</b>.</p>

<p>When clients connect to the server, the server should provide separate
and concurrent sessions for each user. This can be accomplished using
a new process for each user (via fork) or via threads. Each connected
user should be able to run the following commands:</p>

<ul> 
<li> <b> traceroute [destination machine]: </b> Your server program
should take the destination machine as an argument. This can either be
an IP address or a DNS host name. The server will then execute the
traceroute utility on the supplied destination and display the result
to the user. You should <b>NOT</b> develop your own traceroute
implementation: reporting the results of the traceroute utility is
sufficient. The server must confirm that the destination machine
parameter is syntactically valid (composed only of letters, numbers,
the &quot;.&quot;, and the &quot;-&quot; characters), but the
traceroute command output can be used to report other errors (for
example, invalid host name/IP address).<br><br></li>

<li> <b> traceroute [file name]: </b> A user can optionally provide a
"filename" instead of a host name or IP address. Assume that this file
is present in the server's local directory (the client could have
previously uploaded it via alternative means like FTP). If the file
exists, continue as described next. If the file does not exist, your
program should assume it is a destination machine's host name and
proceed according to the above bullet. The file must contain one or
more commands in the format &quot;traceroute [destination
machine]&quot;, with each command on a separate line.  Your server
should execute the traceroute utility sequentially for each command
and display the results.  Separate each result using a distinguishable
delimiter (for example, "----------"). This command <b>IS</b> subject
to rate limiting. If the rate limit is exceeded while processing the
file, all subsequent entries in the file should be discarded and
logged as indicated in the <a href="traceServer.html#rate">rate limiting</a>
discussion. <br><br></li>

<li> <b> traceroute me: </b> Your server program should perform a
traceroute using the client's hostname / IP address as the
target. This should otherwise be identicaly to the first option. <br><br></li>

<li> <b> help: </b> Your server should display the various modes it
supports if a user types &quot;help&quot;.<br><br> </li>

<li> <b> quit: </b> If the user types the &quot;quit&quot; command,
  your server should close the TCP connection, disconnecting the
  client.<br><br></li>

<li> <b>Invalid Commands:</b> If the user enters a command not listed,
  they should receive an error message. This message may indicate they
  should try the &quot;help&quot; command.<br><br></li>

<li> <b>Automatic Time-out:</b> In addition to the above commands, the
  server should monitor the connection for inactivity. If more than 30
  seconds elapse since the user last entered a command, valid or
  invalid, the server should print a message indicating the user's
  session has expired and then close the TCP connection, terminating
  the connection. Automatic time-outs should be <a href="traceServer.html#log">logged
  at the server</a>.<br><br></li>

</ul>

<h2> Resources and Restrictions</h2>

<p> Begin by familiarizing yourself with the <b>traceroute</b>
  utility. Public <b>traceroute</b> servers, of the kind you will
  develop in this project are available
  at <a href="http://www.traceroute.org/">http://www.traceroute.org/</a>. </p>

<p>You are required to use either C or C++ for this assignment.
Additionally, you must use the native Linux/BSD socket system
calls. You may not use other socket libraries. No credit will be given
to solutions that do not adhere to these requirements.  These
restrictions are being made so you become familiar with the details of
lower-level socket programming. Libraries other than socket libraries
(dealing with options for example) will generally be acceptable;
however, when in doubt ask the instructor or an AI.</p>

<p>As always, you are encouraged to avail yourself to Internet
resources and Linux manual pages when completing the
assignment. Socket tutorials such
as, <a href="http://beej.us/guide/bgnet/output/html/singlepage/bgnet.html">http://beej.us/guide/bgnet/output/html/singlepage/bgnet.html</a>
will be helpful in understanding socket programming. However, <b>you
MUST ensure you write your own code</b> and that you <b>CITE what
resources you use</b>, including web tutorials and discussions with
individuals outside of your group.</p>

<p>The following system calls will likely be required to complete the
assignment: <b>accept</b>, <b>bind</b>, <b>close</b>, <b>dup2</b>,  
<b>fork</b>, <b>gethostname</b>, <b>getprotobyname</b>, <b>htons</b>, 
<b>listen</b>, <b>recv</b>, <b>send</b>, <b>setsockopt</b>, 
<b>socket</b>, and <b>waitpid</b>. Before getting started, you should
consult the manual pages for each of these system calls. To perform
the traceroute, you can combine the <b>dup2</b> and the <b>system</b>
system calls to invoke the traceroute utility and redirect its
standard output and standard error to a TCP socket. Some other
approaches could be to use <b>fork</b> and <b>execve</b> or
<b>popen</b> to run the program. Other approaches are also
acceptable.  Concurrency can be handled with processes using fork or with threads using the pthreads library.</p>

<p>Build your program incrementally.  Here is a road-map to use: </p>

<ol>

<li> Create a &quot;hello, world&quot; server. This server could just accept a
connection, print a message, and disconnect the user.</li>

<li> Expand the program to echo user input.</li>

<li> Allow a user to enter a destination machine and output the results of a
traceroute to that IP or host name.</li>

<li> Add support for reading from a file. </li>

<li> Add policy options and command line argument reading.</li>

<li> Add logging functionality.</li>

<li> Handle concurrency requirement.</li>

</ol>

<h2> Deliverables and Grading</h2>

<p>Submit your code, and project files as a single archive file (.tar or
.tar.gz file formats only) via <a href="http://oncourse.iu.edu/">OnCourse</a>.
Shorly after the submission deadline, demo slots will be posted on
the <a href="https://www.cs.indiana.edu/cgi-pub/p538/demos/">Demonstration
Scheduling System</a> (a reminder will be posted on
the <a href="https://www.cs.indiana.edu/cgi-pub/p538/fall2012/wwwboard/">Web
Board</a>). You must schedule an appointment to demonstrate your project.
Groups that fail to demonstrate their project will not receive credit for the
project.  If a group member fails to attend his or her scheduled demonstration
time slot, it will result in a 10 point reduction in his or her grade.</p>

<p>In addition to testing your code for various test cases, the AIs will be
  explicitly evaluating the contributions of individual project partners.  In
  cases where they determine that partners have not contributed equally,
  differential grading will be used.  The instructor and the AIs reserve the
  right to determine appropriate penalty in such cases.</p>
